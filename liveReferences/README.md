The question we're trying to answer here is "how long does a layer stay live?".
For example, if I have a set of 3 layers, with 2 levels of referencing, can I override the bottom level of referencing from the top level? 
It looks like the answer is no if we use prims for referencing, but yes if we use sublayers
